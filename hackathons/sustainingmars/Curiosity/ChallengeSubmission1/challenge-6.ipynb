    "\n",
    "1.Cats are really popular types of pet, that are lightweight, quickly-adopted and well-suited. Moreover we can establish a correlation between our cat and an less time of adoption which definitly would be a plus point in our journey to Mars. All the benefits include:\n",
    "~Lightweight=less then 100 lbs\n",
    "~Fast Time of Adoption= less then 3 weeks mean\n",
    "~Age= Most of the Cats in this list are less then 3 years\n",
    "~Popular= The Correlation with the time of adoption and the number of cats in the list show us that cats are really popular. \n",
    "    External Factors:\n",
    "~Really Popular\n",
    "~Self-Reliant\n",
    "~Entertaining\n",
    "~Compassionate and Affectionate\n",
    "~Supportive for Mental Health. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.Dogs are also really popular types of pet, and depending on the type they can be light-weight, young, and popular. They also have a pretty sufficent time of adoption and other correlations based on the data. \n",
    "All the benefits include:\n",
    "~Fast Time of Adoption= less then 3 weeks mean\n",
    "~Age= Most of the Dogs in this list are less then 5 years\n",
    "~Popular= The Correlation with the time of adoption and the number of dogs in the list show us that dogs are really popular. \n",
    "    External Factors:\n",
    "~Really Popular\n",
    "~Energetic\n",
    "~Playful\n",
    "~Compassionate and Affectionate\n",
    "~Supportive.\n",
    "~Great for elders all well as children.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Lizards are lightweight, young, and fairly popular with their time to adoption. All their benefits include:\n",
    "All the benefits include:\n",
    "~Lightweight=less then 50 lbs\n",
    "~Fast Time of Adoption= 3-4 weeks mean\n",
    "~Age= Lizards in this list are less then 3 years\n",
    "    External Factors:\n",
    "~Self-Reliant\n",
    "~Playful\n",
    "~Fun\n",
    "~Inexpensive needs\n",
    "~Not many needs or desires\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Based on the data, a rabbit is an pet without many advantages nor disadvatages. These include:\n",
    "~Age= Most of the Rabbits in this list are less then 5 years\n",
    "~Average Weight- Rabbits weigh less than 150 lbs in this list.\n",
    "    External Factors:\n",
    "~Popular\n",
    "~Self-Reliant\n",
    "~Compassionate and Affectionate. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.Tarantulas have many legs, are expensive, may be terrifying for others, and are not-in-demand. According to the data, all the tarantulas have the least amount of benefits which include:\n",
    "~Lightweight=less then 1 lbs\n",
    "~Fast Time of Adoption= 1 week\n",
    "~Age= Around 2 years\n",
    "~Diverse\n",
    "    External Factors:\n",
    "~Interesting to watch\n",
    "~Fairly low needs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# General Reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "1.In Mars, we would need relatively more \"attractive\" and more adoptable pets, as keeping these pets in the adoption centre for a long time, would not be a good option. Thus, this leads us to our data, where we have created a graph on which the time to adoption in weeks. Based on our observations, the lower the time, the more adoptable a pet becomes, and thus we would need to chose a pet with really low time to adopt. Which concludes us to two pets; the cat and the dog. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.In Mars, we would also require a pet with young age and less weight. In this way, we would need a less expensive and less capability rocket since the pets would be more light. Moreover, the young age would assure that the residents of Mars are occupied with the pets for a longer time, and do not feel the need to keep getting pets, which may not be a possible on mars. This plan would be both econmically and sentimentally benefitive! Even though, the weight and size of the animal correlate, it really depends on the size of the animal we choose. But, I would come to a conclusion on the best pets as cats as young and with less weight. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.In Mars, we would need a not a variety of pets, but more of the same type of pet. As human behavior goes, if a person has, another person would be more inclined to buy the same, rather then being unique by themselves. There proves our histogram where the dogs have the most population. And thus, according to our data, we would need to have dogs as a significant population in our pet's list. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.In Mars, we would need a pet with a lesser amount of legs, which would make the spacesuit much cheaper and easier to create. Which is why you need a pet with a lower mode amount of legs in an animal. Which would make the Tarantula lower in our list, and animals like dogs, cats, and rabbits. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.In Mars, we would need a pet with good health due to the lack of resources, supplies, and people living there. Thus, we would also need middle-aged animals, to make sure they can sustain the environment on mars. This would not only be good for the people but also the other younger pets, who would find a motherly figure, the same species, to nurse them. Moreover the pets would also need to be different genders for equality, and diversity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extra Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though, we can make a reasonable judgement by the data given, we need to consider extra outside factors in our judgement with the animals. In my list, I organized the animals along with these external factor as an important part in pets. \n",
    "1.Allergies= Even though, cats seem as a popular choice throughout this list, many people are also allergic to cats, approx. 1 in 7. This is almost twice as much as people are allergic to dogs, and then the list continues on the other animals like rabbits, lizards, and tarantula.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Popularity= The second most popular cat in the 'world' is cats, and the third most popular is dogs. The other three animals continue futher down in this list. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.Fear= Even though cats and dogs can be scary, across the world, most people are scared of animals that are non-slimy inverterberates like spiders, then lizards, and then all other pets (ie- rabbits, dogs, and cats). \n",
    "\n",
    "# Specific Reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Wade- Row Number 6 is a young cat, with less weight and relatively low adoption time. He would be a great option to bring on mars, as he is an ideal cantidate with all the right factors, people look for when searching to adopt a pet. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.Mittens- Row Number 1 is a young female cat with relatively low weight, and fast adoption time. She would be a suitable pet in mars, according to our observations and an ideal pet to chose. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.Nori- Row number 17 is a dog with fast adoption time, young age. According to our observations, and the conclusion that we are suppossed to have a relatively significant amount of dogs, Nori would be a great option. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.Max-Row number 16 is a young dog, with a reasonable amount of weight. Even though, he does not have a great time of adoption, he would be a great addition to our list of animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Buddy- Row number 21 is a lizard with a low amount of weight, and fast adoption time. Even though, it would be really hard to make a spacesuit, and according to the other factors, to adopt a lizard, Buddy adds diversity in our list, which is really needed. This lizard provides this diversity with more better factors then the other animals, if we analyze our data. \n",
